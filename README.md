## üîç Overview

### My Meal Planner :calendar:

My Meal Planner App is a weekly **React calendar** with **local API** (JSON Server) as a database to manage meals and recipes. The calendar is rendered from the database and contains a form to submit new meals, generating daily meal plans. Besides that, user can get recipes from [**spoonacular API**](https://spoonacular.com/food-api), save them to the database and add them to a meal.
